# Practice Promises

1. Create a function that creates a random number and returns a promise that resolves to the random number.

    ```js
    // Write the function here
    
    
    
    ```

2. Use this function to get two random numbers and add them together. Log the result to the console. Do _not_ use an `async` function to do this.

    ```js
    // Write your answer here
    
    
    ```

3. Start a sandbox project locally, and make a request to any API using promises, then display a selection of the data in the DOM.

4. In the same sandbox project, use `Promise.all()` to make two requests, and then display a selection of the results from both.

5. Write a function that recieves a button element as an argument. The function should return a promise that resolves when the button is pressed. Once it resolves, it should log a message to the console.

6. Modify the function so that it doesn't resolve only once, but as many times as the button is pressed.
