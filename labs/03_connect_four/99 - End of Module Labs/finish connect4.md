# Extending the Connect 4 Project

Implement these features into your version of the Connect 4 project.

1. Locking board after a win. If clicking your board after a winner has been declared causes a stone to be placed, or the winner to be declared again, make it so that clicking the board does nothing.
2. If your project doesn't have one, implement a reset button, so that at any stage in the game, the user can reset the game. When a winner has been declared, overlay a reset button over the board.
3. Implement a way to keep score over various games. For instance, you could have a box that counts the number of games won by black or red in that session.
4. Implement an introduction screen that lets you choose a board size before starting to play.
5. Implement a way to undo a move with an button next to the board.
6. Implement a way to _replay_ the game once it's over. That is, the moves played during the game should appear quickly on screen, showing you every move that was played.
