# Make Some Templates

Being able to quickly spin up a new sample project or sandbox environment is an essential skill for any developer, and will come in especially hand for these labs.

In these labs you'll create two types of sandboxes:

- One basic one that will be just one HTML file.
- Another one that will be a folder contianing a set of HTML, JS and CSS.

Having these templates will allow you to easily copy them to start a new sandbox.

Finally, create a "scratch" copy, one where you can quickly test out transient ideas that you may not need to create a whole new copy for. Sort of as a scratch pad.

Here are the specific instructions for these labs:

1. If you haven't already got a GitHub repository for your snippets, notes, or templates, make one now. See this as your lifelong developer's notebook.
2. Create a template HTML file that has a few text elements and a button, all with appropriate `id` attributes. Make some script tags for some in-line JS. Something that you can quickly copy and experiment with.
3. Create a template HTML, CSS and JS file, all linked up, again so you can copy the containing folder and have something to experiment and test with.
4. Create a copy of each of these templates and call them "Scratch", which can serve as a scratch pad for you to test out quick transient snippets that you will delete later.
5. Push these to your developers notebook and paste the link to the repository below.

6. Go to codesandbox.io and to codepen.io, create an account and explore the offerings there. These are also great for testing, but there are limitations that you may run into because they are not local projects.
