# Coding Nomads JavaScript 201 Labs

**Important**: Do _not_ fork!

Go to the [cloning instructions](cloning.md) and follow the steps there to get set up.

## Where to Work

There are three types of activities in this course:

1. **Labs** - These are exercises that you should do at the end of each chapter. You'll find the labs in the [labs folder](labs). You should do these directly in the labs folder.
2. **Module Project** - This is the project that you'll work on throughout each module. You need to create a standalone GitHub repository for each project and work on it there. Don't work on the module project here.
3. **Extras** - These are "Learn by Doing" assignments, miscellaneous assignments and your own experiments/explorations. You can do these in the [scratch folder](scratch). Keep these nicely organized.

Check out [organizing your solutions](organizing-solutions.md) for ideas on how to organize your work. You'll want to stay organized, make sure your files are easy to navigate, and make your code readable. Not only for your future self, but for your prospective employers!

## Labs

You'll see the course structure mirrored in the `labs` folder. At the end of each corresponding chapter, you should do the labs in the folder.

Some folders don't have any labs, usually because that chapter was focused on building the module project. So you won't see any folders for those chapters.

## Module Project

Each module has a project that you'll work on throughout the module. You should create a new GitHub repository for each project and work on it there. Don't work on the module project here.

## Scratch Pad

Throughout the course there are "spoilers" and exercises for you to do. Place the results of those exercises in the [scratch folders](scratch). These folders also mirror the main structure of the course. You can use these folders to do your own experiments, explorations, and miscellaneous assignments.

## Extra Projects

If you are working on a side project, library, or a variation on one of the module projects, that's great! You're really showing some initiative that makes you very valuable as a new hire üëè Make sure you are putting your best foot forward and create new repositories for these projects. You can then link to them from your main GitHub profile page, and it'll be another great portfolio piece to show off to potential employers.

## Remember the Git Flow

In this course you'll be expected to follow the Git flow of:

- Creating a branch in your repository before you do make any changes
- Working on interdependent files in your branch
- Once finishing those files, creating a pull request
- Requesting a review from your tutor, or reviewing your work yourself
- Starting another branch (always from `master` or `main`) to continue working on something else

This will give you a good workflow to follow, and it will also help you to get used to the Git flow that you'll be using in the real world.

## Keep on Coding

To become a successful developer you need to grind! Make sure you're putting in regular practice time. You'll get better with practice, and you'll get better faster with regular practice.

Unfortunately there's no magic pill or shortcut. You need to find a way to distinguish yourself from other candidates. You can do that by showing that you're a hard worker and that you're passionate about coding. You can do that by showing that you're putting in the time and effort to learn and practice.

Even though most employers search for expertise, there are many willing to take a chance on a junior developer. You just need to show that you're willing to learn and that you're willing to put in the time and effort to become a great developer.

You'll also get better with feedback, so make sure you're getting feedback from your peers and mentors.

You're doing great! Keep on coding and learning. You're going to be a great developer! üöÄ
