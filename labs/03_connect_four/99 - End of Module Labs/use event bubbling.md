# Practice using event bubbling

These labs are intended to be implemented on top of a working Connect 4 project. You can do this in the demo version of the project, a copy of your project (another branch in the Git repository), or in your development branch of your project if you like the idea of it.

The feature you will implement is a move counter, it will show the total number of moves played so far.

You should implement this using only _one_ event listener and handler.
