# Get Set Up

These labs are about making sure you are properly set up for the module project and your own version of it.

If you have completed the Python or Java courses, then this is your chance to use one of the backends you made, or to custom make one for your version of the module project. You can even just make a backend to act as a proxy between the APIs described in the course and your front-end, hosted on GitHub.

Make sure you have the API keys that you need. OpenWeatherMap requires you register for a key, for example.

Another way to manage access to APIs is by using RapidAPI. It's an idea to register for an account even if you don't plan on using it.

Have a look at some interesting APIs that you could use for this dashboard project, and note down your top 3 picks below, and add a sentence for how this might be used in conjunction with the other API's:

The idea here is to combine info from more than one API in a creative way.
