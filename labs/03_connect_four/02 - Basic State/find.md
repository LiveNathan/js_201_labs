# Practicing Finding

Create a new sandbox for these exercises.

All the excercises here use the `users.json` file in the resources.

1. With the `.find()` method, find the user whose username is `mgreatex8n`. Present the full user object on the DOM using a `for ... in` loop.

2. Use the `.findIndex()` to get the index of the user whose favorite phrase in meetings is "evolve extensible solutions"

3. Use the `.every()` boolean method to verify that all users have a numerical `id` field.
