# Develop the Micro Library Further

In the course you have started out creating your own library that serves as an abstraction to create elements without typing too much.

Customize it, change the way an element can be created or create more specific functions to do different tasks.

Change the function names, and the arguments you pass to it. Change the way you interact with it. Split up the functionality, have various creator functions. It's all up to you, go wild!

Inlcude the current version of your JS library as a file in this folder.
