# Practicing Method Chaining

**Do this lab after completing the other labs in this folder.**

Create a new sandbox for these exercises.

Taking the array represented in `weather.json` in the resources. use **method chaining** to:

- First use `.filter()` to select only entries for "Vancouver"
- Use `.map()` to return only temperatures (be sure to convert the temperatures to Celsius if need be)
- Use `.reduce()` to return an object representing the frequency of temperatures recorded.

Present the result in a table in the DOM
