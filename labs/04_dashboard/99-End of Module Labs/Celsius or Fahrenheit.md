# Extend the Module Project

The demo project displays celsius by default, but not all countries use celsius (even though it is clearly superior :P)

Your task is to do some research, find a way to determine the countries that use Fahrenheit, and find a way to display the temperature in Fahrenheit if the IP geolocation returns one of those countries.
