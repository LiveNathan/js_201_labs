# Explore the Ecosystem

This course is all about vanilla JavaScript, but out in the professional world, people use libraries extensively. It's important to be proficient with vanilla JavaScript, but also to know how to research and use libraries, the landscape for which is always changing.

Note that you'll often see installation instructions that get you to install with `npm`. But most will have an alternative that just involves adding a `<script>` tag to your HTML, sometimes this is called "installing via CDN".

1. Search the web, research some popular JavaScript libraries, and choose 3 that sound interesting to you.

   ```text
   1.
   2.
   3.
   ```

2. Choose one of these, set up a sandbox project, and create a "Hello world" example using that library. If the library you chose doesn't have an easy to follow example to get started, choose another. It should be something relatively quick to get up and running (around 30 mins).

3. Create another sandbox project with JQuery, and learn just enough JQuery to select an HTML element and change it's text. Then create a button, and add an event listener (using JQuery, of course), that will change the button text when you click the button.

4. Check out some CSS libraries, choose one you like and make another sandbox hello world example with one of them. That is, just style a few elements with the tools or classes provided for by the library. For instance, you could check out Bootstrap, Bulma, or Pico.css.
