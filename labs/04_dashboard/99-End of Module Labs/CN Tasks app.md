# Mini Project

This is a project to put into practice everything you've learnt so far.

Using the [Coding Nomads Tasks API](http://demo.codingnomads.co:8080/tasks_api/swagger-ui/index.html#/), create an single page app that will:

- Ask the visitor to select a user profile, or create a new user.
- Once the user has been selected or created, show the user the tasks associated with that user
- Show the dates associated with the tasks in a human readable format
- Allow the user to create new tasks
- Allow the user to modify existing tasks
- Allow the user to delete existing tasks
- Allow basic navigation back to the user select screen
