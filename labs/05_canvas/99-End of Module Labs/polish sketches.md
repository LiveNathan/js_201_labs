# Work on the Sketches

You have been given some starting points for some canvas sketches.

- Re-work these sketches to put your own personal twist on them
- Create 2 new sketches, here are some ideas:
  - Rotating squares or triangles (You'll need trigonometry for this, though)
  - A bouncing ball affected by gravity (doesn't have to be realistic gravity)
  - A animated tunnel, achieved by making small squares, or circles at the center of the screen getting bigger and bigger
  - Animating the tree, which could involve simply changing the angle of it's branching over time. This can be resource intensive, so limit the number of branches
  - Create an animated progress bar with rectangles or arcs.
  - Create a circle that follows the mouse pointer and changes shape, color, size depending on how the mouse moves
  - Create a shape that reacts to keypresses

Sketching with canvas can get _really_ complicated, so make sure you keep things simple, especially when just getting started with a new sketch.

Keep each sketch on a new HTML file and a separate JS Script.

Once you have your sketches, create a site on GitHub that hosts all your sketches so you can share them.
