# Remember the Git Flow

In this course you'll be expected to follow the Git flow of:

- Creating a branch in your repository before you do make any changes
- Working on interdependent files in your branch
- Once finishing those files, creating a pull request
- Requesting a review from your tutor, or reviewing your work yourself
- Starting another branch (always from `master` or `main`) to continue working on something else

This will give you a good workflow to follow, and it will also help you to get used to the Git flow that you'll be using in the real world.
