# Practicing Working with Dates

In a new sandbox project:

1. Write the code needed to add 10 seconds onto a newly initialized `Date` object. The log it to the console

2. With this date object, add 23 milliseconds to it, and log the new `Date` object.

3. Again, using the same date object, print out, on separate lines, the year, the month, the day, the hours, the minutes and the seconds.

4. Log this date object as the number of _milliseconds_ since 00:00 on the 1st of January 1970.

5. Multiply the resultant integer by `1.2` and then convert it back into a date.

6. Use `Intl` to log your Date object in 3 different time zones.

7. Use `Intl` to log your Date object in 3 different formats.
