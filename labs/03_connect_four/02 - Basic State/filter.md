# Practicing Filtering

Create a new sandbox for these exercises.

1. Use the `.filter()` array method with an arrow function on the `stores.json` file in the resources to present a list of only "Target" stores.

2. Use `.filer()` to present another list that are _not_ "Target" stores.

Be sure to present these lists with appropriate headers.
