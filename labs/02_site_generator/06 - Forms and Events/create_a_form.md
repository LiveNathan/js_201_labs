# Create a Form

In these labs you'll create a form that takes someone's details.

1. Create a sandbox and make a form element using JavaScript. That is, don't use HTML form markup, but create the form using `document.createElement()`, or your custom library.
2. Use JavaScript to populate that form with some made up data.
3. Experiment with different input types. Make sure everything has an appropriate label. Be sure to include:

    - Radio buttons
    - Multiple choice buttons
    - `select` elements
    - At least one date input

4. Make a submit button and a submit handler to log all the information input in the form to the console using the `FormData` object.
