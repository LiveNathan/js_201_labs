# Get Wireframing

In front end development there is always overwhelming choice. It makes for a much more focused workflow if you get into the habit of sketching and wireframing your projects before diving in.

1. Do you have a drawing program that you like? If not, try <https://app.diagrams.net/> or do some searching for one that suits you.
2. With this, make a rough wireframe for a website of your choice and save it as a PNG file in this folder.

This should be a detailed wireframe!
